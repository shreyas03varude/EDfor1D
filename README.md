# Exact Diagonalization for 1D Heisenberg Chain
C++ program using Eigen/Spectra libraries to perform exact diagonalization and calculate spin dynamical structure factors of the 1D Heisenberg model.
Accounts for first-neighbor coupling and also second-neighbor coupling.
Intended to be parallelized using OpenMP and ran on a cluster.
